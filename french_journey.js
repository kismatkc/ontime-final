At A2, a learner can understand common expressions and communicate in simple routine tasks requiring direct exchange of information. The focus is on expanding grammar to talk about the past and future beyond the near term, improving sentence complexity, and enlarging vocabulary for daily life topics. Key grammar goals include mastering the past tenses (passé composé and imparfait), the futur simple, basic object pronouns, and comparative structures. Learners will also learn to handle reflexive verbs in past, use negations beyond ne…pas (jamais, plus, etc.), and form more elaborate sentences (using connectors and relative pronouns “qui/que”). Vocabulary will grow to cover travel, shopping, health, hobbies, and everyday scenarios in more depth. By the end of Phase 2, the learner can describe experiences in the past, make plans and arrangements, give simple opinions, and navigate most everyday conversations as an “independent user” of French."

    "label": "Week20: Direct Object Pronouns (le, la, les)",
    "value": "Grammar: Direct object pronouns (me, te, le/la, nous, vous, les) and their placement in simple sentences. Practice replacing nouns with pronouns: Je vois le chien → Je le vois. Emphasize usage in both present and passé composé (noting the participle agreement rule with preceding direct object – an advanced note, mention but focus on simpler cases first). Also introduce pronoun “en” for quantities if possible (optional at this stage, can also be next week).\n Vocabulary: Use vocabulary that lends itself to object pronouns – e.g. objects and things already known (books, movies, fruits): le film, la chanson, les clés etc., and short phrases so context is clear: aimer la musique → je l’aime. Also introduce some common transitive verbs: voir (see), aimer, acheter (buy), prendre, connaître (know someone), inviter.\n Skills Practice: Transform sentences using pronouns. Take 5 simple sentences with direct objects and rewrite them using pronouns: e.g. “J’achète le pain” → “Je l’achète.” Practice Q&A: “Tu vois mes parents ?” – “Oui, je les vois.” Listen to a short dialogue and note any instances of le, la, les referring to earlier mentioned items. For immersion, when journaling or speaking this week, challenge yourself to use pronouns instead of repeating nouns once context is clear.\n Measurable Goal: Successfully use direct object pronouns in at least 10 sentences without confusion. You should be able to answer questions like “Où est le livre ? Tu l’as ?” with “Oui, je l’ai.”, or combine two sentences by replacing an object with a pronoun. Mastery is demonstrated if you can translate a short paragraph with repeated nouns into one with pronouns, maintaining correct meaning (e.g., Marie aime son chien. Elle le promène tous les jours.)."

    "value": "Grammar: Indirect object pronouns: lui (to him/to her) and leur (to them) for verbs that take “à” before a person (e.g. parler à, donner à, téléphoner à). Clarify difference between direct vs. indirect objects. Practice using lui/leur in present and passé composé. Also revisit “y” as a pronoun for places or à + thing (if time permits), since y often parallels lui/leur usage but for things/places.\n Vocabulary: Verbs commonly using indirect objects: parler à (speak to), téléphoner à (call), donner à (give to), envoyer à (send to), répondre à (answer), montrer à (show). Sample nouns for people: ami, enfant, collègue. Also phrases like écrire une lettre à quelqu’un.\n Skills Practice: Use lui/leur in context. Do substitution drills: “Je parle à mon frère” → “Je lui parle.”; “Nous avons écrit à nos grands-parents” → “Nous leur avons écrit.” Role-play mini scenarios: calling a friend (Je lui téléphone ce soir.) or giving something to someone. Try a short dialogue where pronouns are used: “Que penses-tu de mon idée?” – “Je lui ai déjà répondu.” If y was introduced: include a couple of y uses (e.g. Je vais à Paris → J’y vais.).\n Measurable Goal: Be able to correctly use “lui” and “leur” in sentences. For example, convert at least 5 sentences with à + person into ones with pronouns (both in spoken and written form). Additionally, demonstrate usage in a short paragraph: e.g. “J’ai trois amis. Je leur parle tous les jours et je leur envoie souvent des messages.” If y is covered, include at least 2 examples with “y” (like “J’aime aller au parc. J’y vais chaque weekend.”). This shows readiness to handle pronouns for smoother, less repetitive speech."

    "value": "Grammar: Relative pronouns “qui” and “que” to connect simple sentences. Qui as a subject relative pronoun (followed by verb) and que as object relative pronoun (followed by subject). Show examples: “J’ai un ami. Il habite à Paris.” → “J’ai un ami qui habite à Paris.”; “J’ai lu le livre. Tu as recommandé le livre.” → “J’ai lu le livre que tu as recommandé.”. Emphasize that qui means who/that as subject, que means whom/that as direct object.\n Vocabulary: Use previously learned vocabulary to form relative clause examples: people and things you can describe. For instance: ami (friend), ville (city), film (movie), chanson (song), professeur (teacher), etc., combined with descriptors: qui est intéressant, que j’aime, que j’ai vu, qui travaille ici, etc.\n Skills Practice: Combine sentences using “qui/que”. Take a list of simple statements and practice joining them. Write 5 combined sentences. E.g., “Paris est une ville. Paris est belle.” → “Paris est une ville qui est belle.” Make it fun by perhaps describing favorite things: “Le film que j’aime le plus est un film qui a gagné un prix.” Speaking: try to include a relative clause when speaking about someone or something (e.g. “J’ai un collègue qui parle trois langues.” in conversation).\n Measurable Goal: Produce complex sentences with “qui” and “que” properly. You should be able to take 5 pairs of simple sentences and join each into one sentence with a relative clause. For instance, say or write sentences like “Le livre que je lis est un roman qui est très célèbre.” without hesitation. Mastery of this shows you can add detail to your speech and writing, moving beyond basic simple sentences."

Explain their placement (jamais, plus, rien go where pas would; personne typically comes after whole verb phrase). Give examples: “Je ne fume jamais.” (I never smoke), “Il n’y a plus de pain.” (There is no more bread), “Je n’ai rien fait.” (I did nothing), “Personne n’est venu.” (No one came).\n Vocabulary: Phrases where these negatives make sense: activities (fumer, voyager, etc.) with jamais; quantities or continuing actions for plus; quelque chose (something) vs rien; quelqu’un (someone) vs personne. Also introduce opposites to understand context: toujours (always) vs jamais, encore (still) vs plus (no longer), tout (everything) vs rien, tout le monde (everyone) vs personne.\n Skills Practice: Use new negatives in sentences. Transform affirmative sentences to negative with these forms: “J’ai encore des amis ici.” → “Je n’ai plus d’amis ici.” Practice Q&A: “Tu voyages souvent ?” – “Non, je ne voyage jamais.” Write a few sentences about yourself using each form (truthful or not): one thing you never do, something you no longer do, something you did nothing of, etc. Listen to a short dialogue or song lyrics with these negatives (many French songs use rien or jamais) to recognize them in context.\n Measurable Goal: Incorporate at least 4 types of negative expressions in your spoken and written French. For instance, be able to correctly say: “Je ne suis jamais allé en Asie.”; “Je n’ai rien oublié.”; “Il n’y a personne ici.”; “Je ne veux plus travailler ce soir.” Doing so in appropriate contexts (and remembering to include the ne) shows a stronger command of French phrasing beyond the basic ne…pas."

Include pronoun usage in imperative (e.g. Donne-le-moi. may be advanced, but at least be aware of constructions like Vas-y – Go ahead). Also cover polite suggestions using il faut + infinitive (impersonal “one must…”) as an alternative to direct commands.\n Vocabulary: Instructional and classroom language – e.g. écoutez, répétez, écrivez, attendez, regardez. Also direction verbs (reusing tourner, aller, continuer) and perhaps some recipe cooking terms for practice (mélanger – mix, ajouter – add, couper – cut, faire cuire – cook).\n Skills Practice: Give and follow instructions. Create a simple set of instructions (like a recipe or steps to do a task) in French with 5 steps using imperatives: “Préchauffez le four à 180 degrés. Mélangez le sucre et les œufs…” Alternatively, write instructions for a household task or a set of rules (e.g. library rules: “Ne parlez pas fort. Éteignez vos portables.”). For oral practice, give a friend directions or commands in French (in a playful context) or mentally instruct yourself in French while doing a routine task.\n Measurable Goal: Confidently use the imperative in French to give at least 5 different commands or instructions, including at least one in the negative form. For example, you should be able to say “Ouvre la fenêtre, s’il te plaît.” and “Ne faites pas de bruit.” appropriately. Additionally, write a short list of instructions (like a recipe or how-to list) in French, demonstrating you can communicate procedural steps clearly."

    "value": "Grammar: Not a new grammar tense, but focus on polite and formal language conventions. Practice using vous consistently in formal situations. Introduce common polite constructions like Pourriez-vous…? (Could you...?) – an introduction to conditional for politeness, and phrases like Je voudrais… (I would like) (revisiting from week 7 but in broader contexts). Also mention common subjunctive-triggering polite phrases like Il faut que... (It’s necessary that...) as a segue to B1, without delving deeply into subjunctive conjugation yet.\n Vocabulary: Polite expressions: Excusez-moi, s’il vous plaît, je vous en prie (you’re welcome/formal), merci de…, je suis désolé(e). Also phrases for social niceties: Enchanté(e) (nice to meet you), Bon appétit, À bientôt, etc. Cover basic cultural etiquette words: titles (Monsieur, Madame), saying bonjour in shops, tutoyer vs vouvoyer (using tu vs vous).\n Skills Practice: Role-play formal situations. For example, simulate meeting someone for the first time (using vous, Enchanté), asking a stranger for help (Excusez-moi de vous déranger...), or making a polite request at an office or store (Pourriez-vous m’aider à trouver…?). Write a short formal email request with proper salutations and polite closings. As immersion, observe French etiquette videos or read a short guide on French politeness to pick up culturally appropriate phrases.\n Measurable Goal: Demonstrate you can navigate a formal interaction in French. For instance, you should be able to politely ask for assistance or information from a stranger or a clerk in French with at least 3 polite phrases in one exchange (e.g., “Bonjour Monsieur. Excusez-moi, est-ce que je pourrais avoir un renseignement, s’il vous plaît ?”). You should also be comfortable switching to formal register (vous) consistently in such interactions.

Make sure earlier issues are resolved (e.g. correct auxiliary choices in PC, using pronouns without confusion).\n Vocabulary: Review A2 vocabulary domains: travel and transportation, shopping, food (expanded), health/basic medical (e.g. saying where it hurts), hobbies, work/office basics, and others tackled. Fill any gaps by studying a frequency list or DELF A2 word list to ensure coverage of common daily terms.\n Skills Practice: Integrated simulation: This week, engage in comprehensive practice that ties everything together. For example, simulate planning a trip: discuss future plans (futur), compare destinations (comparatives), say what you did on past trips (PC/imparfait), ask for information (politeness), etc. Or simulate a day in a French town: from buying breakfast, asking directions, visiting a doctor (explain symptoms), to writing a postcard about the experience – covering a variety of scenarios. Additionally, attempt a mock DELF A2 exam task: e.g. write a short informal email (60-80 words) to a friend about your holiday plans or leave a voicemail introducing yourself for a homestay family.\n Measurable Goal: Achieve A2 proficiency and be ready to enter B1 material. In concrete terms, you should be able to sustain a 5–6 minute conversation on everyday familiar topics (family, daily life, past experiences, plans, preferences) with reasonable fluency and only minor errors. You should also be capable of writing a cohesive paragraph or simple letter (~100 words) about a familiar topic (e.g. describing an event or giving an update) using A2-level grammar correctly. For a formal check, consider taking a practice A2 test or an online A2 self-assessment to confirm that you can communicate effectively in routine tasks and simple exchanges.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Intermediate (B1) – Weeks 27–39\n\nOverview: Phase 3 targets B1 (Intermediate) proficiency. At B1, the learner becomes an “independent user” capable of handling everyday matters and familiar topics with some ease. According to CEFR, a B1 user can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters, deal with most situations while traveling in a Francophone area, produce simple connected text on familiar topics, and describe experiences, events, hopes and ambitions and briefly justify opinions. The focus now shifts to expanding grammatical complexity and improving fluency. Key grammar objectives include: mastering all indicative tenses (introducing the plus-que-parfait for “had done”, conditionnel présent for “would do”, and subjonctif présent in common expressions); using si clauses for hypotheses; mastering relative pronouns like dont and more complex structures; and an introduction to indirect speech and the passive voice. Vocabulary will broaden to more abstract topics and professional domains: work, education, society, technology, etc.. Skills-wise, the learner will practice sustaining longer conversations, expressing opinions and feelings, and handling unexpected situations in French. By the end of Phase 3, the learner should be comfortable discussing a wide range of familiar topics at length, be understood by native speakers, and have the tools to argue a point or handle complications in conversation – setting the stage for the more nuanced B2 level."

    "value": "Grammar: Plus-que-parfait (PQP) – formation (imparfait of avoir/être + past participle). Explain usage: to denote an action that was already completed before another past action (e.g. “J’avais déjà mangé quand il est arrivé.” – I had already eaten when he arrived). Practice forming PQP for verbs with both auxiliaries. Highlight common phrases: déjà (already) often used with PQP, and how it combines with narrative in PC/imparfait.\n Vocabulary: Temporal phrases indicating sequences: déjà (already), avant (before), après (after), une fois que (once [something had happened]). Use with everyday contexts: arriving, leaving, finishing work, etc. Also scenarios like avoir déjà fait quelque chose (had already done something).\n Skills Practice: Narrative practice with PQP. Write a few 2-sentence mini-stories combining PQP and passé composé: “J’avais fini mes devoirs quand mon ami m’a téléphoné.” Or “Il était fatigué parce qu’il n’avait pas bien dormi la nuit d’avant.” Orally, practice sentences with “had done” to explain conditions or reasons in the past. For listening, find or create exercises where one has to identify which action happened first.\n Measurable Goal: Successfully incorporate plus-que-parfait in past narratives. You should be able to create at least 5 sentences where you clearly indicate one past action occurred before another (e.g. “Lorsque j’ai déménagé à Paris, j’avais déjà étudié le français pendant deux ans.”). This capability is a stepping stone to more complex storytelling and is characteristic of intermediate-level narration."

    "value": "Grammar: Subjunctive present – introduce the concept as a mood used after certain expressions of necessity, desire, emotion, or doubt, often following que. Teach how to form it for regular verbs (ils stem + -e, -es, -e, -ions, -iez, -ent) and a few important irregulars (être: que je sois, avoir: que j’aie, aller: que j’aille, faire: que je fasse). Focus on common triggers: il faut que… (it’s necessary that), je veux que… (I want that), je suis content que… (I’m happy that), bien que… (although). Emphasize that at B1 we use it in memorized expressions rather than mastering all cases.\n Vocabulary: Expressions that trigger subjunctive: Il faut que…, Il est important que…, Je souhaite que…, Je suis heureux que…, Il vaut mieux que…. Emotions: triste, content, surpris etc. and desires: vouloir, préférer, souhaiter. Also pour que (so that) as a purpose conjunction with subjunctive.\n Skills Practice: Use basic subjunctive in context. Start with writing a few requirements or recommendations: “Il faut que tu fasses tes devoirs.” / “Mes parents veulent que je sois prudent.” Practice speaking a couple of these as advice or personal feelings: “Je suis content que tu viennes me voir.” It’s okay if usage is formulaic at first. For immersion, note subjunctive phrases in things you read (subjunctive is common in written French after certain phrases).\n Measurable Goal: Use the subjunctive mood correctly in at least 5 sentences that express necessity, desire, or emotion. For example, be able to say “Il faut que j’améliore mon français.”; “Je voudrais que nous allions à Paris cet été.”; “Bien que ce soit difficile, je continue.”. Mastery at this stage means recognizing these common subjunctive forms and using them in controlled contexts – a clear indicator of reaching intermediate grammar competency."

    "value": "Grammar: Conditionnel présent – formation (future stem + imparfait endings) to express what would happen in hypothetical situations or to be polite. Introduce “si” clauses (Type 2): si + imparfait, conditionnel présent to talk about hypothetical present/future situations (e.g. “Si j’avais plus de temps, je voyagerais.” – If I had more time, I would travel). Contrast with Type 1 (si + présent, futur) learned earlier at A2. Also highlight vouloir in conditional (je voudrais) as extremely common polite phrase (link back to courtesy).\n Vocabulary: Hypothetical scenarios – gagner à la loterie (win the lottery), avoir plus de temps/argent, vivre ailleurs, etc., to use in “if I were..., I would...” statements. Also aimerais (would like) to state wishes. Phrases like à ta place (if I were you) for giving advice.\n Skills Practice: Discuss hypothetical situations. Write a list of 5 “If …, would …” sentences about yourself: “Si j’étais président, je…”, “Si je pouvais voyager librement, j’irais en Amérique du Sud.” Practice these out loud, focusing on the conditional verb endings. Additionally, use conditional to be polite or soft in requests: “Pourriez-vous m’indiquer le chemin?” (Could you show me the way?). Maybe do a fun exercise: each day pose a hypothetical in French to think about (e.g., “Que ferais-tu si tu avais un million d’euros ?”).\n Measurable Goal: Fluently produce “si + imparfait → conditionnel” sentences. You should be able to formulate at least 5 meaningful hypothetical statements about various topics (personal dreams, advice, etc.) using the correct verb forms (imparfait and conditional). For example: “Si j’habitais en France, je parlerais français tous les jours.”; “Il aiderait plus sa famille s’il en avait la possibilité.” Achieving this demonstrates an ability to think beyond factual reality – a hallmark of B1 level proficiency in grammar."

Show usage: “C’est un ami dont je me souviens bien.” (whom I remember well; replaces de cet ami), “Le livre dont j’ai besoin” (the book I need; replaces besoin de ce livre). Also cover “où” as a relative pronoun for places/times (meaning “where” or “when” in this context): “La ville où je suis né” (the city where I was born), “Le jour où on s’est rencontrés” (the day when we met).\n Vocabulary: Phrases that trigger de: avoir besoin de, se souvenir de, parler de, envie de etc., to illustrate dont. Practice with content from earlier topics: la personne dont je parle, le pays dont il rêve (the country he dreams of). For où, use times and places: l’année où…, l’endroit où….\n Skills Practice: Combine sentences using “dont” and “où”. For dont: create sentences like “J’ai visité le musée. Tu m’as parlé de ce musée.” → “J’ai visité le musée dont tu m’as parlé.” For où: “2005 est l’année. J’ai fini mes études cette année.” → “2005 est l’année où j’ai fini mes études.” Write 3 examples of each. Practice them in spoken form too. Try to incorporate at least one dont and où clause when speaking about something in your life (like “C’est quelque chose dont je suis fier.” – It’s something I’m proud of).\n Measurable Goal: Use “dont” and “où” correctly in complex sentences. For example, be able to say/write 3 sentences with “dont” (such as “C’est un sujet dont nous avons discuté en classe.”) and 3 with “où” (“Je me souviens du moment où j’ai reçu la nouvelle.”). Handling these relative pronouns properly indicates a growing sophistication in sentence structure, as expected at B1+."

    "value": "Grammar: Reported (Indirect) Speech – learn how to relay what someone said using que and shifting pronouns/verbs one tense back. At B1, focus on reporting present tense statements to imperfect, and future to conditional. E.g., Direct: Il dit: “Je suis fatigué.” → Indirect: Il dit qu’il est fatigué (if still true) or Il a dit qu’il était fatigué (backshift if reporting later). Cover common verbs for reporting: dire que, demander si, répondre que. Also note changing pronouns and time words: aujourd’hui -> ce jour-là, etc., though keep it basic.\n Vocabulary: Speech verbs: dire, demander, répondre, annoncer, expliquer. Words indicating reported questions: si (if) for yes/no questions (e.g. Il a demandé si tu venais. – He asked if you were coming). Simple quotes to transform, like statements about weather, plans, etc.\n Skills Practice: Transform direct quotes to indirect speech. Start with easy ones: Marie: “Je viendrai demain.” Report: Marie a dit qu’elle viendrait le lendemain. Write a set of 5 direct statements and their reported versions. Also try converting a simple question: “Est-ce qu’il fait beau ?” → Elle a demandé s’il faisait beau. Practice explaining what someone told you: “Mon patron m’a dit que je pouvais partir tôt.” Listen to a short dialogue and verbally report its content in the third person.\n Measurable Goal: Accurately report speech in French in both written and spoken forms. You should convert at least 5 direct statements or questions into indirect speech with proper tense and pronoun adjustments. For example: “Luc: ‘J’ai perdu mes clés.’” → “Luc a dit qu’il avait perdu ses clés.”; “Elle m’a demandé si j’avais fini le projet.” Being able to do this indicates a higher level of grammatical control, as expected by the end of B1."

    "value": "Grammar: Pronoun “y” (replacing “à + place/thing”) and “en” (replacing “de + thing/quantity”). Recap from earlier (if “y” was introduced briefly in Phase 2) but now deepen understanding. Examples: Je vais à Paris → J’y vais.; Il pense à son travail → Il y pense. And for en: J’ai deux enfants → J’en ai deux.; Elle boit du café → Elle en boit. Also using en with expressions of quantity (beaucoup de, assez de): Tu as beaucoup d’amis ? – Oui, j’en ai beaucoup.\n Vocabulary: Use various contexts: travel (aller à [lieu]), being inside places (on est à la banque – on y est), activities one thinks about or participates in (participer à un projet – y participer). For en, talk about consumption (manger du pain, acheter des livres – en acheter), or having amounts of things.\n Skills Practice: Substitution practice with y/en. Write sentences and then the transformed version: “Je réponds à la question.” → “J’y réponds.”; “Nous avons acheté des pommes.” → “Nous en avons acheté.” Practice speaking short dialogues where you intentionally use y and en: e.g. “Tu vas au bureau ? Oui, j’y vais.”; “Tu as des animaux ? Oui, j’en ai un.” Do drills until using y/en feels natural and you don’t need to translate in your head.\n Measurable Goal: Effectively use “y” and “en” pronouns in conversation to avoid repetition. Aim to correctly use y and en in at least 5 examples each. For instance, spontaneously respond to questions with pronouns: “Est-ce que tu vas souvent à la bibliothèque ?” – “Oui, j’y vais une fois par semaine.”; “Tu as lu beaucoup de livres ce mois-ci ?” – “Oui, j’en ai lu quatre.” Mastery of these pronouns greatly improves fluency and is a strong B1/B2 indicator."

Example: “Le gâteau a été mangé par les enfants.” (The cake was eaten by the children). Explain that the past participle agrees with the subject in gender/number when using être. Practice converting a few active sentences to passive and vice versa. Note that French tends to use passive less often than English, but it’s needed in formal writing.\n Vocabulary: Use simple sentences in various tenses for practice: present passive (La porte est ouverte par le gardien.), past passive (Les lettres ont été envoyées hier.), future passive (Le nouveau magasin sera inauguré l’année prochaine.). Vocabulary: items and actions: construire une maison → une maison est construite, etc. Also introduce impersonal “on” as an alternative: On m’a volé mon sac can be equivalent to passive Mon sac a été volé.\n Skills Practice: Transform sentences to passive. Start with present: “Les chefs cuisinent le repas.” → “Le repas est cuisiné par les chefs.” Then past: “Les élèves ont écrit la lettre.” → “La lettre a été écrite par les élèves.” Also try passive in context: describe a process (e.g., “Ce produit est fabriqué en France.”). Write 5 pairs of active/passive sentences. Though spoken use of passive is less, practice one or two spoken examples or recognition (e.g., news headline style: “Trois personnes ont été blessées dans l’accident.”).\n Measurable Goal: Show you can form and understand the passive voice. Convert at least 5 active sentences into correct passive form (maintaining meaning and proper agreement). For example, “Le roman a été écrit par Victor Hugo.”; “Ces décisions seront prises par le directeur.” While you won’t use passive constantly in conversation, recognizing and forming it is an important skill for reading comprehension and formal communication at B1/B2."

(… ago), tant que (as long as), lorsque/quand (when) etc. Also cover depuis vs pendant vs il y a explicitly for expressing time spans: depuis 2010 (since 2010, still ongoing) vs pendant 2 ans (for 2 years, completed) vs il y a 2 ans (2 years ago).\n Skills Practice: Enhance narratives with connectors. Take a simple story or description you made earlier and enrich it by adding connectors: “D’abord… Ensuite… Enfin…” in a sequence, or “pendant que j’attendais, quelque chose s’est passé.” Write a paragraph about a personal experience or routine using at least 5 different time connectors. Practice speaking about your day or a past trip using these words to connect events smoothly (rather than lots of short choppy sentences).\n Measurable Goal: Use a variety of time expressions and connectors to make your French speech and writing more fluid and organized. Aim to include at least 5 sequencing/linking words correctly in a spoken story of 2-3 minutes or a written paragraph of ~100-120 words. For example: “D’abord, je me suis levé tôt. Ensuite, j’ai pris le train pour Lyon. Pendant le trajet, j’ai lu un livre.

Introduce a few basic argument connectors: parce que (because), car (for), donc (therefore), cependant (however), par exemple (for example) to support opinions. This will prepare for more formal debate at B2.\n Skills Practice: Debate light topics. Pick simple, familiar topics or preferences (e.g. preferring city vs countryside, discussing an aspect of culture, a movie opinion). Practice stating your opinion: “À mon avis, apprendre une langue est très utile.”, giving a reason: “... parce que cela ouvre l’esprit.” Simulate a friendly debate: state an opinion and then a counter-opinion: “Certains disent que..., mais je ne suis pas d’accord, je pense que...”. Write a short argumentative paragraph (50-80 words) on a topic like \"Should we have a 4-day work week?\" using opinion phrases and at least one contrast word (mais/cependant).\n Measurable Goal: Be able to articulate your opinion on a familiar issue and provide at least 2 reasons or supporting points in French. For example, speak for about 2 minutes about your favorite form of exercise and why, using phrases like “Personnellement, je crois que le yoga est excellent pour la santé, car il réduit le stress et améliore la souplesse.”* Also, demonstrate you can politely agree or disagree with someone’s statement in conversation with appropriate phrases.

No heavy new grammar, but heavy on comprehension and re-expression.\n Materials: Take a short French article (perhaps a 100-word news piece or a short story excerpt appropriate for B1) or an audio snippet (like a 1-minute news report) and work on summarizing it. Could also use graded readers or French learning podcasts intermediate level.\n Skills Practice: Written summary: Read a paragraph and write 2-3 sentences summarizing its content in simpler French. Oral summary: Listen to a short dialogue or part of a TED-style talk in French and then try to explain in French what it was about. Paraphrase some statements from others in different words. This also ties into reported speech practice.\n Measurable Goal: Summarize a short passage of French in your own words. For example, after reading a one-page story or article, be able to recount the main points in 4–5 sentences in French, without copying sentences verbatim. Or, listen to a 1–2 minute French audio and then speak for 1 minute summarizing what was said. Reaching this goal shows improved comprehension and the ability to reformulate information – key skills as you approach upper-intermediate level tasks."

    "label": "Week37: Writing Practice – Letters and Emails",
    "value": "Grammar/Format: Focus on writing skills. Learn the format of an informal email/letter vs. a semi-formal letter in French. Phrases for opening/closing: Informal (Salut …, À bientôt, Gros bisous) vs. formal/semi-formal (Madame, Monsieur,… Je vous prie d’agréer…, Cordialement). At B1, likely focus on informal to semi-formal (e.g., an email to a language exchange partner or a simple cover letter for a job).\n Vocabulary: Email/letter vocabulary: Cher/Chère … (dear ...), Merci pour ton email, Comment vas-tu?, J’attends ta réponse avec impatience (I look forward to your reply), etc., for informal. For semi-formal: suite à (following ...), dans l’attente de votre réponse, cordialement.\n Skills Practice: Write a couple of letters/emails. For example, write an informal email (100-120 words) to a friend about what you’ve been doing recently and asking them some questions. Then write a semi-formal letter of about the same length, perhaps a request or application: e.g. applying to volunteer or requesting information about an apartment for rent, using appropriate salutations and polite forms (without being too advanced). Have someone check if possible, or compare with model letters.\n Measurable Goal: Be capable of writing a structured message in French. Specifically, produce an informal email (~120 words) clearly communicating personal news or requests (with proper openings/closings), and a semi-formal letter or email on a straightforward topic (e.g., a letter to a school or company) with correct format. This shows you can adjust tone/register in writing – a necessary skill by B1."

    "label": "Week38: Broader Vocabulary – News, Media, and Technology",
    "value": "Vocabulary: Expand into more abstract or current-event topics. Learn key terms in areas like news/media (journal, article, gouvernement, élection, environnement, technologie – technology, internet, réseaux sociaux – social networks), and common issues (la santé, l’éducation, le chômage – unemployment). This isn't one narrow theme, but a push to read simple news in French and discuss.\n Grammar: No new grammar, but reinforce using context clues for vocabulary, and perhaps the causative faire constructions or more complex sentences if they appear in reading (though deep dive into causative can be left for B2).\n Skills Practice: Reading and discussing a news article. Choose a short article from something like “Le Petit Journal” or a news blog for French learners. Read it, underline new words, find meanings, then write a summary or list 3 interesting facts from it. Discuss (or monologue) about the topic: “J’ai lu un article sur l’environnement. Il disait que… Je pense que…”. Also practice describing a piece of technology you use, in French, to incorporate tech vocab.\n Measurable Goal: Increase your lexical range to include common news and media topics. Concretely, you should learn at least 20 new words from news/technology domains and be able to use them in sentences. Test this by summarizing a current event in French (orally or in writing) in ~5 sentences, correctly using some of the new vocabulary. Being able to engage with simpler authentic materials like news is a sign of solid B1-B2 transition."

    "week": "39",
    "label": "Week39: B1 Review & Prep for B2",
    "value": "Grammar: Comprehensive review of B1 grammar. Revisit troublesome spots: subjunctive triggers and forms, conditional and si clauses (maybe also introduce si + plus-que-parfait → conditionnel passé briefly for those curious, although that’s mainly B2), all the pronouns (direct, indirect, y, en, relative pronouns), and complex sentence structures. Ensure you can seamlessly switch tenses (past, present, future) as needed when speaking.\n Skills Practice: Full simulation of B1-level tasks. Engage in a longer free-form conversation or self-talk in French for ~10 minutes: introduce a personal topic (like your experience learning French, your last vacation, your future plans) and cover it in depth, using varied tenses. Practice a mock DELF B1 oral: e.g., present a short exposé (3-4 minutes) on a familiar topic (your hobby, your city) and then simulate answering follow-up questions. For writing, attempt a B1-level essay (around 180 words) on a familiar topic that requires giving your opinion (for example, “advantages of learning a foreign language” or a letter complaining about a service, etc.). Get feedback if possible.\n Measurable Goal: Achieve B1 proficiency across all skills. By the end of this week, you should be comfortable having a 5-10 minute conversation on non-trivial familiar topics (not just survival phrases, but expressing opinions, telling stories, etc.) with moderate fluency and only occasional prompting. You should also be capable of writing a coherent multi-paragraph text (~180-200 words) on a general theme with B1 grammar and vocabulary. Essentially, ensure you're meeting the B1 descriptors: you can handle most situations while traveling, enter unprepared into conversations on familiar topics, and explain your opinions or plans simply. This foundation will allow you to tackle the final phase towards B2 with confidence.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Upper-Intermediate (B2) – Weeks 40–52\n\nOverview: Phase 4 targets B2 (Upper-Intermediate) proficiency – the final stretch to reach the roadmap’s goal. At B2, you become a truly independent user of French, able to understand complex texts, converse fluently with native speakers, and express yourself clearly in both speech and writing on a broad range of subjects. The focus now is on refining grammar and style: consolidating advanced grammar points like the full subjunctive mood usage, all types of conditional sentences (including the past conditional for regrets), advanced connectors and relative pronouns (lequel* and compounds), and nuanced structures like the passive voice, indirect speech, gerunds, and more formal expressions. Vocabulary expansion is critical: learners will acquire more specialized and academic vocabulary (e.g., for politics, science, arts) and idiomatic expressions to sound more natural. Skills training will emphasize argumentation, debate, and synthesis: summarizing articles, writing well-structured essays, and participating in discussions or debates presenting and supporting a viewpoint. There is also a focus on adjusting register (formal vs informal) appropriately. By the end of Phase 4, the learner should be capable of passing a B2-level exam (such as DELF B2), meaning they can interact with native speakers with minimal strain, understand implicit meanings, and produce detailed and coherent language in complex tasks."

    "week": "40",
    "label": "Week40: Advanced Subjunctive Usage",
    "value": "Grammar: Deepen subjunctive mood knowledge: review present subjunctive conjugation for all verbs, including irregulars (aller, faire, pouvoir, savoir, vouloir, etc.). Learn more contexts that require subjunctive beyond necessity/desire: expressions of doubt or uncertainty (Je doute que…, Il est possible que…), emotion (Je suis triste que…), and certain conjunctions that always take subjunctive (e.g. bien que – although, pour que – so that, à condition que – provided that, quoique – even though). If appropriate, introduce past subjunctive (subjonctif passé) for completeness (e.g. Je suis content que tu aies réussi.) – though its use is less frequent, recognizing it is useful.\n Vocabulary: Phrases and conjunctions that trigger subjunctive: douter que, il faut que, il est important que, vouloir que, être heureux que, craindre que (fear that). Also impersonal expressions of opinion requiring subjunctive: Il est dommage que…, Il est peu probable que…. This will naturally bring in higher-level vocab for expressing feelings and judgments.\n Skills Practice: Subjunctive in action. Write a series of sentences or a short paragraph using a variety of subjunctive triggers: e.g. “Je doute que tout le monde comprenne le problème. Bien que ce soit difficile, il faut que nous fassions un effort.” Speak out some of these to get comfortable with the irregular forms in particular. You might craft a short argument that uses subjunctive: “Il est important que les gouvernements agissent, afin que la situation s’améliore.” Consider doing targeted exercises where you fill in subjunctive vs indicative.\n Measurable Goal: Use the subjunctive mood confidently in diverse sentences. Aim to correctly employ at least 8 different verbs in subjunctive across various triggers (necessity, doubt, emotion, conjunctions). For example, be able to say “Je doute qu’il dise la vérité.”; “Il est possible que nous ayons des examens plus tôt.”; “Bien que j’aie peu de temps, je continue à pratiquer.” without hesitation. Being comfortable with these forms and knowing when to use them is a strong sign of B2-level grammatical control."

    "week": "41",
    "label": "Week41: Conditional Past & Si Clauses (Type 3) – Expressing Regrets",
    "value": "Grammar: Conditional Past (Conditionnel Passé) – formation (conditional of avoir/être + past participle) to say what would have happened. Use in si clause Type 3: si + plus-que-parfait, conditionnel passé for past hypotheticals/ regrets. Example: “Si j’avais su, je ne serais pas venu.” (If I had known, I wouldn’t have come). Emphasize pronunciation differences are minimal (often context-driven) but the concept is important for complex hypotheticals.\n Vocabulary: Phrases of regret or hindsight: si seulement... (if only...), j’aurais dû (I should have), j’aurais pu (I could have). Situations to express: missed opportunities, mistakes, alternate histories (e.g., Avec plus de temps, j’aurais voyagé davantage.).\n Skills Practice: Express regrets and alternate outcomes. Write 5 sentences about things you wish had been different: “Si j’avais eu plus de temps hier, j’aurais fini ce projet.” / “J’aurais aimé te rendre visite, mais je n’ai pas pu.” Practice speaking these sentences, and perhaps exchange regrets with a conversation partner (a bit melancholic, but useful!). Also practice “J’aurais dû…” (I should have) + infinitive constructions for personal regrets: “J’aurais dû étudier plus tôt pour l’examen.”\n Measurable Goal: Correctly formulate past hypotheticals and regrets. You should be able to state at least 5 “If I had…, I would have…” sentences that make sense and use proper tenses. For instance: “Si nous avions pris le train, nous serions arrivés à l’heure.”; “Elle aurait pu réussir l’examen si elle avait étudié davantage.” Additionally, use j’aurais dû/pu in a couple of sentences to express personal regret or hindsight. Mastery of this structure shows you can discuss complex unreal situations in the past – a clear B2-level skill."

    "week": "42",
    "label": "Week42: Nuanced Relative Pronouns (lequel, auquel, duquel & “ce qui/ce que/ce dont”)",
    "value": "Grammar: Tackle the more complex relative pronouns. Lequel and its forms (laquelle, lesquels, lesquelles) – often used to mean “which” after prepositions (other than de): e.g. “Les outils avec lesquels je travaille…” (the tools with which I work). Also auquel/auxquels (contraction of à + lequel) and duquel/desquels (de + lequel) for things: “C’est le sujet auquel je pense.”; “La région duquel il parle…”. Additionally, cover “ce qui / ce que / ce dont” for unspecified antecedent (“what” in the sense of “that which”): e.g. “Ce qui me plaît, c’est la musique.”, “Dis-moi ce que tu veux.”, “Je ne comprends pas ce dont tu parles.”.\n Vocabulary: Use more abstract or formal examples to justify usage of these forms: official contexts or written style often use lequel, etc. e.g. conditions dans lesquelles..., la raison pour laquelle..., les droits auxquels nous avons accès. For ce qui/ce que, any general statement: “Ce qui est important, c’est la santé.” (What’s important is health).\n Skills Practice: Practice complex relative clauses. Write sentences that incorporate these pronouns: for example, “L’entreprise pour laquelle je travaille est internationale.”; “Le débat durant lequel ils se sont disputés a duré 2 heures.” For ce qui/que/dont: “Ce dont j’ai besoin, c’est plus de temps.” Try combining multiple ideas into one sentence using these tools. Reading advanced texts and noticing these forms also helps; perhaps take a paragraph from a newspaper and identify any lequel or ce qui.\n Measurable Goal: Use lequel (and variants) and “ce qui/ce que/ce dont” correctly in sentences. Create at least 3 sentences using lequel/auquel/duquel type structures and 3 using ce qui/que/dont. For instance: “C’est un domaine dans lequel je n’ai pas d’expérience.”; “Ce dont nous avons discuté est confidentiel.” If you can incorporate these naturally into your writing or speech, you’ve achieved a fine grasp of complex clause structures at the B2 level."

    "week": "43",
    "label": "Week43: Mastering Formal and Indirect Speech",
    "value": "Grammar: Refine indirect speech, including sequence of tenses in complex cases (reporting past statements requires shifting tenses: present->imparfait, futur->conditionnel, passé composé->plus-que-parfait, etc.). Practice converting not just one sentence but whole quotations or dialogues to reported form. Also incorporate formal expressions and the subjunctive in reported commands or desires. Additionally, practice formal inversion questions (like “Demanda-t-il” in literature, though not common in speech, useful for recognition).\n Vocabulary: Formal speech markers: déclarer que, annoncer que, prétendre que (claim that), demander si/ce que/pourquoi... and some formal time expressions needed in backshift: ce jour-là, le lendemain, la veille (the day before) for converting aujourd’hui, demain, hier.\n Skills Practice: Convert a news report or dialogue to indirect form. Take a short direct quote from a news article or an interview and rewrite it as reported speech in a summary. Example: Direct: Le ministre: “Nous allons baisser les impôts l’année prochaine.” → Indirect in a news story: Le ministre a annoncé qu’ils baisseraient les impôts l’année suivante. Write a short news-paragraph style summary of a fictional interview using all indirect speech. Also practice speaking: describe a conversation you had with someone by reporting what both of you said (using il/elle m’a dit que… j’ai répondu que…).\n Measurable Goal: Fluently use reported speech to summarize dialogue or statements. You should be able to take a given quote or message and accurately convey it indirectly, adjusting pronouns and tenses. For instance, be capable of transforming something like “Elle a dit : ‘J’étais inquiète, mais j’ai réussi.’” into “Elle a dit qu’elle avait été inquiète, mais qu’elle avait réussi.” without confusion. Achieving this indicates strong control over narrative perspective and tense usage in French."

    "value": "Vocabulary: Focus on language needed for professional or academic settings. Terms related to the workplace (meeting – réunion, deadline – date limite, report – rapport, internship – stage, skills – compétences), and academic terms (research – recherche, exam – examen, thesis – mémoire or thèse, scholarship – bourse). Also, business French basics if relevant (invoice – facture, client, fournisseur, chiffre d’affaires, etc.). Perhaps also touch on writing academic papers: introduction, conclusion, argument, analyser, cause, conséquence.\n Skills Practice: Simulate a professional scenario. For writing, try composing a formal email or cover letter for a job application in French, using some of this vocabulary and formal phrases. For speaking, practice describing your professional background or field of study in detail as you would in a job interview or academic setting: “Je suis diplômé en…, j’ai de l’expérience dans…, j’ai effectué un stage où j’ai géré…”. Engage with an actual French job posting or university program description and discuss what they are looking for or what you would say.\n Measurable Goal: Acquire at least 20-30 new professional/academic terms and be able to use them appropriately. For example, you should be comfortable introducing yourself in a professional context in French for about 2-3 minutes, mentioning your education, work experience, and skills, using correct vocabulary (and grammar like passé composé/imparfait* for past experiences). Additionally, be capable of writing a formal cover letter (~150-200 words) in French that uses formal tone and relevant vocabulary, as this is something a B2 learner aiming for professional use of French might need to do."

Also idioms or phrases commonly seen in news: faire la une (make headlines), manifestation (protest), prendre des mesures (take measures).\n Skills Practice: Debate or discuss a current event in French. Choose a news story or a societal issue you are interested in. Prepare to speak about it: first summarizing the issue, then giving your viewpoint with supporting arguments (this combines summarizing and opinion skills). For instance, talk about a recent election or a cultural event/festival in a French-speaking country. Alternatively, have a mock debate: e.g., debate the pros and cons of social media on society, entirely in French, using newly acquired vocab and connectors (donc, cependant, par conséquent, en revanche).\n Measurable Goal:* Be able to sustain a conversation or argument on a current issue for at least 5-6 minutes. This means presenting the topic with pertinent facts and clearly stating your opinion with supporting arguments and perhaps acknowledging a counterargument. You should demonstrate use of topic-specific vocabulary (for example, words relating to government or environment if those are the topics). Hitting this goal means you can engage with more complex, abstract topics as required at B2."

    "value": "Vocabulary: Learn common idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms to sound more natural. Examples: “prendre son temps” (take one’s time), “tomber dans les pommes” (faint), “avoir le cafard” (feel down), “coûter les yeux de la tête” (cost a fortune), “être au courant” (be informed). Also casual connectors like “tu vois”, “quand même”, “bref”. Emphasize which idioms are appropriate in spoken informal contexts vs. written.\n Skills Practice: Use idioms in context. Try to incorporate a couple of idioms into your daily French conversations or writing this week. For example, in your journal write “J’avais le cafard hier, alors j’ai appelé un ami pour discuter.” or tell a friend “On va y aller doucement, il n’y a pas le feu (there’s no rush).” Also, practice understanding idioms by reading an article or watching a French YouTuber who uses some colloquial language; note any phrases you don’t literally understand and look them up.\n Measurable Goal: Add at least 10-15 idiomatic expressions to your repertoire and use them appropriately in sentences. You should be able to understand these idioms when heard, and use some of them in informal conversations or writing. For example, slip an idiom into a conversation naturally: “Je vais arrêter de travailler pour ce soir – je n’en peux plus, je suis crevé.”* Using idiomatic language correctly is a strong indicator of B2-level fluency and comfort with the language’s nuances."

Use debate phrases: Je suis d’avis que…, Il est indéniable que… (it’s undeniable that), Certains pensent que… mais…, Il faut reconnaître que… (one must acknowledge that), Cependant, je maintiens que… (However, I maintain that...). Emphasize presenting advantages and disadvantages clearly (use avantage, inconvénient).\n Skills Practice: Choose a debate topic (e.g., “Should cities ban cars from downtown?” or “Is technology making us more isolated?”). Prepare a short opening statement (2-3 minutes) in French presenting one side of the argument. Also prepare a rebuttal to the opposite view. If you have a conversation partner, actually have a debate exchanging points. If solo, practice by recording yourself presenting arguments and then counter-arguments. Ensure to use formal linking words and persuasive language.\n Measurable Goal:* Be capable of presenting a clear, coherent argument on a familiar or societal topic in French, lasting about 5 minutes, and handle a short Q&A or rebuttal session. Essentially, simulate a mini DELF B2 speaking exam: present a stance with an introduction, supporting points, conclusion. You should demonstrate good control of complex sentences, use of subjunctive or conditional where appropriate (for nuance), and idiomatic phrases for persuasiveness. Successfully doing this means you can articulate viewpoints at a B2 level in speaking."

Review structure: introduction (introduire le sujet), developing paragraphs (avancer des arguments pour/contre, exemples), conclusion (conclure en ouvrant éventuellement). Use connectors for writing: Premièrement, deuxièmement, en outre (moreover), cependant, néanmoins (nevertheless), par conséquent (therefore), en conclusion. Ensure use of formal register (no slang, limited first person unless appropriate, maybe the general “on” or passive voice).\n Practice: Write an essay (~250 words) on a prompt, e.g., “Les avantages et les inconvénients du télétravail” (pros and cons of remote work) or any topic of interest at societal level. After writing, revise it focusing on paragraph coherence and variety of expression (check for repetitive words or simple sentences to replace with more complex forms). Possibly have it corrected by a fluent speaker or compare with sample essays.\n Measurable Goal:* Be able to compose a 250-word argumentative essay in French with a clear structure and logical flow. The essay should contain an introduction stating the issue, 2-3 body paragraphs with points and examples, and a concluding statement. It should demonstrate B2-level grammar usage (subjunctive in appropriate clauses, correct tense sequencing, complex sentences) and a range of vocabulary. If such an essay would likely score well on a DELF B2 writing section, you’ve met the goal."

While earlier you did a semi-formal letter, now aim for high formality: e.g., writing to a company, a government office, or drafting a short report summary. Include formal salutations (if letter: Madame, Monsieur, and closing Veuillez agréer, Madame, Monsieur, l’expression de mes salutations distinguées.). If a report style, practice impersonal and passive structures to sound objective. Possibly practice writing a summary report of an event or a set of data (like summarizing survey results or a meeting – useful for work context).\n Vocabulary: Formal phrases: Suite à votre lettre,… (following your letter), Je vous écris afin de…, Dans l’attente de votre réponse,…, Veuillez… (please, in formal imperative). For reports: selon les données,…, il ressort que… (it appears that), en conclusion.\n Skills Practice: Write a formal letter of ~150-200 words, for example, a complaint to a service provider or an application for a position, ensuring the tone is polite and professional throughout. Also, as a separate task, write a short formal report summary: for instance, summarize the outcome of a project or meeting in 1-2 paragraphs, using a neutral tone and formal language.\n Measurable Goal: Confidently handle formal written communication in French. Specifically, produce a properly formatted formal letter addressing a hypothetical situation (with no grammar mistakes in the complex formal constructions), and a concise report or summary demonstrating clarity and formality. If you can do this, you have the writing skills expected of a B2 user in a professional or official context."

Use B2-level materials: radio news segments, podcasts, TV interviews or debates, French films or series (without English subtitles – use French subtitles if needed). The goal is to understand not just gist but details and different accents or speaking speeds. Practice note-taking while listening to longer pieces. Work on ability to infer meaning of unknown words from context.\n Materials: For example, choose a 5-minute news analysis from RFI’s Journal en français facile (news in easy French) and gradually move to normal news. Or a TEDx talk in French on YouTube (they often have clear articulation). Or a French movie: try to follow scenes without pausing, then re-watch with subtitles to check comprehension.\n Skills Practice: Listen daily to at least 10 minutes of French audio that's a bit above your comfort level. Summarize what you heard. Use transcripts if available to verify what you missed. Shadowing exercise: pick a short segment and try to repeat it word-for-word to improve comprehension and pronunciation simultaneously.\n Measurable Goal: Be able to comprehend extended spoken French on various topics at near-normal speed, even if there are some unfamiliar expressions, as long as the subject is reasonably familiar. A concrete test: understand the main ideas and most details of a ~5-minute radio news summary or an interview without needing a transcript.

Conduct all your daily activities in French as much as possible: think in French, keep speaking/writing throughout the day (narrate tasks, describe surroundings, etc.). If possible, schedule a conversation or tutoring session with a native speaker and insist on using only French for an hour or more.\n Practice: Mock exam practice: Take a mock DELF B2 exam or similar proficiency test. This includes: listening to B2 audio and answering questions, reading B2-level texts (e.g., a news article ~ 700 words) and answering comprehension questions, writing an essay (which you did in week 48), and doing an oral presentation + conversation (which you practiced in week 47). Time yourself according to exam conditions. Afterward, evaluate your performance or have someone evaluate it, noting any areas of weakness for last-minute improvement.\n Measurable Goal:* Identify any remaining weak points under near-real conditions and address them. For example, perhaps you find when speaking for 10 minutes straight, you still struggle with a particular tense – now you know to review that. Or maybe fast listening in a noisy context is hard – practice one more day of that. By the end of this week, you should feel capable of thinking and functioning in French for extended periods without reverting to your native language, a true sign of B2 immersion. Achieving a passing score on a practice B2 exam or receiving positive feedback from a native that you can communicate effectively without major gaps would indicate you’re meeting the B2 objectives."

This week is about solidifying confidence. Tackle any last challenging bits (maybe a last review of subjunctive irregulars or practice of strong pronunciation points like liaisons and intonation for sounding natural).\n Real-World Test: If possible, find a way to test your French in a real-world scenario. This could be: scheduling a French-language job interview practice, attending a local Francophone meetup or language exchange and conversing entirely in French, or writing an article or blog post in French and asking for feedback. If planning to take the DELF B2 or another exam, do a final full practice or at least parts of it.\n Measurable Goal:* Achieve B2 Proficiency. By the end of Week 52, you should feel that you can communicate in French with fluency and confidence in most situations. As a final benchmark, you should be able to sustain a natural 10+ minute conversation with a native French speaker on non-specialized topics without them needing to slow down noticeably, and they should confirm that you are easily understandable and engaging. You should also be capable of producing detailed and structured French texts (essays, emails, reports) of a few hundred words with only minor errors. If you plan to take a certification, you are ready to do so. Congratulations – vous parlez français à un niveau B2, prêt à utiliser la langue dans la vie quotidienne, les études ou le travail !"
